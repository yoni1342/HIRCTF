          Organizational Structure of HORN
        </h2>
        <div className="py-10 px-7 leading-8 space-y-5 lg:w-[50%]">
          <p>
            HORN is structured as a two-tier organization that has three core
            business processes and two support business processes. The three
            core processes deal with activities directly related to the mission
            of the company, including consultancy, training &amp; capacity
            building, and research and publication. The corresponding business
            processes are: (1) Consultancy business process, (2) Training and
            capacity building business process, (3) Research and publication
            business process, and (4) the Regional and International Affairs
            business process. On the other hand, the two support business
            processes were designed to provide relevant support for the core
            businesses and create synergy for the companyâ€™s effort of achieving
            its goals and/or accomplish its mission successfully. These business
            processes include: (1) Corporate Planning and Business Development
            process, and (2) Finance and Administration process. Each business
            process is led by a manager who is accountable to the General
            Manager of the company. The structure is found to be very suitable
            for HORN to carry out its duties and realize its mission.
